# 🌍☄️ Asteroid Impact Simulation Tool  

**Project Giga HACKS – NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**  

An interactive web-based simulation that visualizes the consequences of asteroid impacts on Earth using **NASA’s Near-Earth Object (NEO) datasets**.  
Users can input asteroid parameters such as size, speed, angle, and impact location to generate real-time predictions of:  
-  Crater size  
-  Energy release  
- Blast radius  
-  Global impact visualization on a 3D Earth  

---

##  Motivation  
Asteroid impacts are rare, but potentially catastrophic.  
This project aims to make **planetary defense science accessible and engaging** by transforming raw NASA data into interactive visualizations.  
It helps students, educators, and enthusiasts explore "what-if" scenarios while highlighting the importance of NASA’s **planetary defense missions**.  

---

##  Features  
- Input asteroid parameters (diameter, velocity, angle, density, impact location).  
- Calculate crater size, kinetic energy, and potential damage effects.  
- Visualize asteroid trajectory and impact zone on a **3D interactive globe** (Three.js).  
- Powered by **NASA NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) API** and **CNEOS asteroid data**.  
- Simple, educational, and open-source.

##  Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Visualization:** [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D Earth & impact trajectory  
- **Backend / Logic:** Python for physics-based calculations  
- **APIs / Data Sources:**  
  - [NASA NeoWs API](https://api.nasa.gov/)  
- **Other Tools:** OpenStreetMap (Earth geospatial data), GitHub Pages for hosting  

---

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. User enters asteroid parameters.  
2. The physics engine calculates the impact energy, crater diameter, and shockwave radius.  
3. The system fetches asteroid orbital data from NASA APIs (if available).  
4. Results are displayed with an **interactive 3D visualization** of the Earth and impact site.
